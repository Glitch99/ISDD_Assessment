At the Wild Scot Trust we are passionate about Scottish wildlife
We want as many people as possible to enjoy Scottish wildlife in its native habitat. 
That's why we have gathered information about Scotland's 25 most popular animals. 
And importantly, we are happy to share with our visitors, 
the best places to spot our wildlife.
