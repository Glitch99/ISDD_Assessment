At the Wild Scot Trust we are passionate about Scottish wildlife <br>
We want as many people as possible to enjoy Scottish wildlife in its native habitat.  <br>
That's why we have gathered information about Scotland's 25 most popular animals. <br>
And importantly, we are happy to share with our visitors, <br>
the best places to spot our wildlife. <br>
